# Auctionweb



This is a Online Auction Management System created using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Codeigniter, MySQL. This repository contains all the code to setup the system. We developed this using a localhost server with XAMPP.


For running the application -

1. Install Codeigniter Setup.
2. Unzip the folder and replace the application and assets folder with those in the repository.
3. Setup a local server using XAMPP.
4. Put the modified folder in ./lampp/htdocs
5. Name the folder as auction and you are good to go.
