        <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">
            This study attempts to assess school climate of all public schools of Gujarat. School climate is broadly defined as the â€œnorms, values and expectations that support people feeling socially, emotionally and physically safe.
            The study has brought in desirable outcomes in Western schools but literature about this is non-existence in India.
        </p>
        <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Procedures</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">
        Computer-based online surveys will be administered in schools using an online platform,  Qualtrics. In some cases, paper-pencil surveys can be administered as well if the school does not have required IT infrastructure.  Schools have to login using School Code and password  and they will be given one week of time-window to administer surveys to all respondents (teacher, students, and principal). 
        </p>
